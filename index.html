            <h1> As you begin to move, you realize that the room smells of mold and decay. Strange. The ground beneath you feels soft. Also strange. You walk into what you assume is the middle of the room and bump into a foreign object. Wow what a strange day. Or night. Or afternoon. I don't know so how would you? Anyway, double click to figure out this object.</h1>

            <h1> You decide to wait in the room, like a coward. No,no,no, I get it. You have no idea where you are or how you got there, it's rational to just wait it out. Unfortunately, it was kinda really important that you kept moving so..... You died from hunger. Maybe you should've kept moving, huh? Just blindly trusted the strange room you were trapped in? </h1>

It looks like someone put a forest in a room. The rooms pretty big too. So big that you didn't notice the giant dark mass heading toward you until I pointed it out.</h1>

Unfortunately, you fell in a ditch while you weren't looking and broke your legs. You bleed out. Why did you listen to me? Who said that was a GOOD idea? For all you know, I was the one who put you in danger. Also I didn't think that rooms had ditches, so... </h1>
